                    Bay windows combine fixed and operable windows, creating a curve that extends beyond the exterior walls. Bay windows maximize interior space
                    by protruding out from a homeâ€™s exterior. They also provide additional natural light and greater airflow, broadening the feel of a room with panoramic views and depth. Bring more light into your home

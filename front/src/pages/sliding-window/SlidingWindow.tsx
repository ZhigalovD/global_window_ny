                    Sliding windows glide open horizontally from one side to the other. Sliding on a track, they require no extra space to operate making them a popular choice along patios, porches, tight walkways or anywhere you wouldnâ€™t want an outward swinging window.
                    Sliding windows offer easy and controlled access
                    to fresh air and provide excellent energy
                    efficiency when closed.
